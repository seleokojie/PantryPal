# PantryPal

## Grocery Tracker Application (Final Project for COSC 435)

PantryPal allows users to track the food as well as when their food expires. 

Using the Edamam API for food data, PantryPal allows users to search for any food and track its: quantity, expiration date, macros, and calories. The user can then search through these items based on their expiration dates. 

PantryPal also has an intuitive grocery list feature that allows users to quickly make a list of items they want to shop for, check the items they selected, and clear the list once done.
